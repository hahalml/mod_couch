Description: 

The module uses libcurl in the same way mod_xml_curl does
and connects to a given binding url where expects JSON
documents. Only URL formation and the specific parameters
passed to the backend make the module couchdb specific.

The module simply translates cURL-fetched JSON documents
to XML for internal switch parsing magic and could eventually
be turned into a generig cURL JSON module.

The motivation for hacking this module is to eliminate
the middle software layer between the distributed database
backend and the switch.
